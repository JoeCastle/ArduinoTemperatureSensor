# ArduinoTemperatureSensor
This was completed as part of a group project for my university course. The primary goal of the module was not just programming, but collaborative development. Working together with other students do develop a product from start to finish, with communication between group members as a key aspect. This involved planning sprints, allocating tasks and weekly meetings.', 'My role on the project was Embeded Developer. It was my job to design and build the arduine circuit, aswell as write the code to collect the temperature, act on the readings and post the results to a webpage. Other roles in the group included web evelopers, project manager, business manager, database administrator. 

The product itself was simple. We were given a pre-defined project brief, an Arduino kit, and randomly assigned roles and responsibilities. We had to create and design a system that would read the temperature of a room, light an LED depending on the temperature (Green = cold, yellow = fine, red = hot), and send the data to a webpage where to use could visualize the historical data. The user would also be able to define which temperature was considered too hot or too cold.
